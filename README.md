The purpose of choosing this work is to find out which factors are more important to live a happier life. As a result, people and countries can focus on the more significant factors to achieve a higher happiness level. We also will implement several machine learning algorithms to predict the happiness score and compare the result to discover which algorithm works better for this specific dataset.
There are three parts to my report as follows:
